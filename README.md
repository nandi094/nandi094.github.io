## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

In this project we have to optimize the performance of the website given.
For optimizing we use **Chrome Developer Tools**.
[1]->Unzip the **zip file**...
[2]->Look for *index.html* file...

[4]->Open the file on any **browser** like *google chrome* or *mozilla firefox*...
[5]->Open **Chrome Developer Tools** by pressing *Shift+Ctrl+i* or similar in the browser...
[6]->Click on **Timeline**...
[7]->Record the loading of *index.html* file...
[8]->Open the website in Google PageSpeed... Look at the ratings..
[9]->Optimize your *index.html* file so that the scores are **Above 90** both on *Mobile view & Desktop view*...
That's it you are done with the first part of the project...
**Congratulations**

#Part 2#

- Optimize the file **views/js/main.js** and make **views/pizza.html** *render with a consistent frame-rate at 60fps*
when scrolling.
- Time to resize pizzas is less than 5 ms using the pizza size slider on the views/pizza.html page. Resize time is shown in the browser developer tools.
[] If you are done with it you are done with your project.
