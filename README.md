## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

##Udacity frontend nanodegree mobile portfolio Project##
#Part 1#
In this project we have to optimize the performance of the website given.
For optimizing we use **Chrome Developer Tools**.
[1]->Unzip the **zip file**...
[2]->Look for *index.html* file...
[3]->RIGHT click with the mouse and click on **open with**...
[4]->Open the file on any **browser** like *google chrome* or *mozilla firefox*...
[5]->Open **Chrome Developer Tools** by pressing *Shift+Ctrl+i* or similar in the browser...
[6]->Click on **Timeline**...
[7]->Record the loading of *index.html* file...
[8]->Open the website in Google PageSpeed... Look at the ratings..
[9]->Optimize your *index.html* file so that the scores are **Above 90** both on *Mobile view & Desktop view*...
That's it you are done with the first part of the project...
**Congratulations**

#Part 2#
In this project we have to optimize the loading of pizza website given.
- Look for *views* folder and open it...
- Look for *pizza.html* file...
- RIGHT click with the mouse and click on **open with**...
- Open the file on any **browser** like *google chrome* or *mozilla firefox*...
- Open **Chrome Developer Tools** by pressing *Shift+Ctrl+i* or similar in the browser...
- You can see the page load time and scrolling time in the console...
- Make necessary Optimizations to **main.js** file so that the **pizza.html** file renders with a consistent frame rate of *60FPS*...
- *hint* : Try changing the size of pizzaImage while loading... for more help watch Stop FSL quiz solution.. You will get some idea
- Time to **resize pizzas** is less than *5 ms* using the *pizza size slider* on the *views/pizza.html* page. Resize time is shown in the browser developer tools.
## What I have done ##
- Used different variable to counter the repeating use age of DOM which makes the rendering faster ie renders with frame rate of 60 FPS...
- Invalidated the determineDx function.. As it was creating Forced synchronous layout....
- Then used some variable to get the pixel value...
- In changePizzaSizes function used definate widths of the pizzas so that it does not repaint the entire page while executing that function
- There is no more query selector in the for loop and no more conversion form pixels to percentages and vice versa...

[] If you are done with it you are done with your project.
**Congratulations**
*You have Optimized the page*
